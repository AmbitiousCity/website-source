Many cities--like the one I live--are experiencing vertical building booms. Three and four story buildings are replaced by high-rises, some of which are eighty stories tall. This increases the density of the city, which has many advantages including compactness and reduced services costs. To locate people near existing transit hubs saves building new transit lines, which many governments are reluctant or incapable of providing. Not everyone likes the idea of a Manhattan or Hong Kong lifestyle since densities prior to the high-rise boom may have been quite modest; living in a high-rise is quite different from living in a Victorian row house.

High-rises depend on elevators, yet many cities developed before their invention. Prior to elevators people had to walk up stairs. The maximum height that people were willing to walk up was about five or six stories. The European pattern is to achieve density was by blanketing the city with large blocks that are five or six stories tall, accessible without elevators. Often there are courtyards in the middle of these blocks. This approach alleviates sprawl but depended on a type of top-down planning and development control foreign to many locales.

In North America the pattern is quite different. In most places, people wished to have access to the ground and to have on-property parking for their cars. The idea of large perimeter walk-up blocks common to European cities was foreign to them. In North America the spaces between buildings and outdoor spaces are generous (though, often under-utilized) and the number of floors to be climbed without an elevator are few. It is not a bad pattern -- especially if you like the idea of landscaping or gardening. Yet, if people can easily acquire an abundance of real estate for their own private purposes it becomes a recipe for sprawl. Sprawl creates collective pain, yet within the context of private comfort and privilege.

Seldom do you see proposals in Toronto for building European-style perimeter blocks with interior courtyards that occupy whole blocks like you might see in Paris in Berlin. Instead, high-rises are seen as the way to go. High-rises have the advantage of not having to assemble block-size parcels: you can build on tiny plots of land. There is usually little regulatory objection to the replacement of low-density development with high-rises, unless it takes place within established residential neighbourhoods or ones with valued streetscapes of historical value. In the downtown core in Toronto there appears to be hundreds or even thousands of suitable sites for high-rises. Often, there is little existing urban context left to protect; a new, gleaming new high-rise is often seen as an improvement over the status quo. A little slice of ersatz Manhattan may be preferable to a parking lot.

Does the invention of the elevator mean that we have to rely on them whenever we build? Are high-rises being built because they help our cities, or is it just because they are easy to build and tend to be profitable for their builders? If the planning goal is the reduction of sprawl with more compact, higher density development, is building high the only way of achieving this? Are there other options?
