This post is only indirectly relevant to the notion of an Ambitious City but seems so startling that I have to write about it. The last few weeks have seen a crisis of people fleeing many countries, most notably Syria, which has been largely destroyed by war. A huge number of people are attempting to gain access to Germany, via Austria and Hungary. 

Germany, without much warning, has become the new migration magnet at the center of Europe. It is relatively easy to get to from the Middle East. You don't have to swim across an ocean. It is rich and economically powerful. Its social services are good. Most of its cities are very attractive. 

Germany is the place where defenseless refugees feel that they can be safe. Angela 'Mama' Merkel encourages such beliefs by her humane comments on their plight and her forceful opposition to right wing attacks within Germany on refugee hostels. Such an approach is not a given from a right-of-center politician such as Merkel. She seems to have grown into that role, as has Germany. 

Meanwhile, the Anglo-American countries like Britain, the USA, Canada and Australia are missing in action. The politics in most of these countries has evolved into something extremely unsympathetic to refugees. US presidential candidates trip over themselves in declaring how little they would do to help refugees. The notion that people might be forced to flee a country to save their lives is viewed with disbelief. 

One way of looking at this crisis is that the usual Western players, known to accept the refugees in the past, are no where to be seen and are shirking their international responsibilities. 

Another way of looking at it--likely related to the first, is that most people have gotten used to the idea of globalization. Products, ideas, media, knowledge, jobs can effortlessly shipped to the far corners of the globe. Many do not like it but most recognize that globalization--in some form or another--is here to stay. People now gathered at the Budapest train station seem interested in testing a new form of globalization--that of the free movement of people, especially when their lives are at stake. If you can ship a toaster, a barrel of crude oil across an international boundary with minimum fuss why not a family threatened with destruction?

The Germany-bound travelers in Budapest seem to recognize--correctly I believe--that there are some countries that will not turn refugees away from their shores or borders if these refugees are lucky and resourceful enough to reach them. In a world riven by terrible conflict in which innocents perish as a remarkable rate, this gives great incentives for many to begin remarkably perilous journeys.
