One of the oddities of living in Toronto is that the aboriginal communities, called First Nations in Canada, are largely invisible. There are almost 40,000 people of aboriginal descent living here [] but you would never know it. 

This is quite surprising considering that the entire city is built on aboriginal land and that many other non-native ethnic groups have parts of town named after them. There are several Chinatowns, a couple of Little Italy's, a Greektown, etc. These are popular parts of town filled with busy bars, restaurants and food markets. Torontonians are justly proud of these ethnic neighbourhoods, since they are fun and safe places to live in and visit, yet are not particularly exclusive to any specific ethnicity or nationality, despite their names.  

However, on the First Nations front the urban nature of aboriginal population is indeed paltry. The author John Lorinc discusses this in some depth in his excellent book
