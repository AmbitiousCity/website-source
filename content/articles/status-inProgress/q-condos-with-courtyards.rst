In Toronto there is huge condo construction boom taking place. There seems to be little talk of a speculative bubble--despite appearances--but much talk of a huge foreign demand for these condos. Often the condo towers are reasonably attractive: gleaming profiles, built of modern materials, with attractive landscaping. Yet, whether they are ten stories tall or forty they are usually just big slabs: they tend to be spatially uninteresting. They tend to be simple shapes with few penetrations or holes in their plans or elevations. This is a shame because they might look a bit more interesting if they did.

Few new condo buildings have interior courtyards. In most of these buildings you walk into the main lobby, you get into an elevator, you get off on your floor and then walk along a corridor to your unit. This seems for those of us not used to living in high-rise buildings to be sad or socially isolating way to live. Or, maybe it is just that many of us are not used to living in high-rise buildings. 

In condos, collective spaces are often limited to lobbies, which are sometimes quite lavish and impressive. There seem to be few in-between spaces where private realms mix with semi-public ones. This mixing of private with semi-public is not that all common with other housing types either. If you live in a detached house then your private realm is inside your house. If you are working in your front yard or sitting on you porch then you might be able to participate in a kind of semi-public space. Your have an opportunity to interact with your neighbours. Depending on your neighbours this may be an enjoyable experience.

In many European or Asian residential building types, such as continental housing blocks, there are often outside public spaces, transition spaces and then outdoor spaces that are open to sky but which are semi-private. These sorts of in-between courtyard spaces are often quite enjoyable and can be spatially rewarding (as well as potentially depressing, dark or insecure). They provide a way of interacting with your neighbours in a way that acknowledges that you are living together in the same building and thus are not total strangers. These spaces don't demand you interact with your neighbours, they merely make interactions with them more likely. 

One collective aspect of condo buildings that tends to be over-emphasized in condo ads is the outstanding social amenity that their roof decks promise their residents. Most condo ads suggest impressive levels of luxury and exclusivity on these collective decks: cocktails on the lounge, barbecues with your closest friends with amazing views of the city below. A nice roof deck in the downtown core of Toronto can provide outstanding views it is true but I've always suspected that such promises are overblown. Like the completely under-used balconies on almost all residential high-rises in this cities, it appears that very few people actually use them except to smoke the odd cigarette.
