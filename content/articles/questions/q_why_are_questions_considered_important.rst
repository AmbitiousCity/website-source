Why are questions considered important?

Questions seem to precede ideas. For each good idea for cities, there seems to be a question that must inspire, or at least inform, the idea.

For example, say you believed that green roofs were a good idea for cities. What would be the preceding question?

- What are good ways of reducing ambient temperatures in cities?
- How can you improve biodiversity and provide habitats for bees in cities?
- Are there ways to make flat rooftops more attractive? 

Once you ask, or formulate the question, then creation of ideas seems easier and more relevant.
