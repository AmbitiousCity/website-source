MC issues: why am I doing this?
--------------------------------------------------

David Byrne's insight
	- You produce work for, and within, a community
	- Your social context makes a huge difference
	- This is what I have found. 
	- Before Carol and her church and my St James, i didn't have a context; now I do; I don't think I realize that this is a big difference

What am I searching for?
	- Trying to find something I can focus on
	- Trying to find a community in which I can perform well
	- Trying to find an adequate day-job
	- Trying to integrate too much: design, music, Haskell, urban theory, satire, creative writing

Could I just write or do I also need to do design?
	- Must do BOTH
	- Write about design: become a well-known blogger (so what)
	- Write about cities and DO design - become something innovative (seldom seen)

What would you do if you had six months to live?
	- Write things down. 
	- Therefore, that is what you must do now

What are my blockages?
	- Lack of something really meaningful
		- other than parenthood, marriage, church, choir
		- that is more than most people!
		- I am not happy enough with what others do not have

What are the things that will join Carol and I together?
	- Write together
	- Things that both can do well in
	- Things that involve Carol and my friends
	- Things that appear good to external observers
	- Things that make us laugh

What were you really happy doing?
	- Writing my blog and having Susan and Ryan praise it
	- Taking photos

What can't be life out of the mix?
	- Writing - probably about design
	- Taking photos of designed things
	- Designing things, but without doing it professionally

What needs NOT be fully professional?
	- Photography
	- Talking to groups
	- Online stuff

What NEEDS to be fully professional?
	- Design reasoning and representation

Stuff and belongings
--------------------------------------------------

People acquire many belongings over their lifetime
	- It costs money to acquire, store, use and dispose of
	- More possessions does not correlate with greater happiness

There is great inequality in possessions
	- Some people have very little (nearby)

Sometimes people lose their possessions
	- Eg. Syrian refugees

No possessions is not comfortable either
	- No touchstones for memory (photographs)
	- No art
	- No books
	- No mementoes
	- No comforts

We tend to associate with people who have similar levels of attachments to possessions as we do



Cool idea: evidence and measurement
--------------------------------------------------

Why is 'evidence' a cool idea?
	- Because people won't believe you when you tell them things
	- They can't relate to what seems obvious to you
	- That is my difficulty in life: people don't want to listen because they can't relate
	- They assume that I know less than I do (because I come off as someone who knows little)
	- I am not satisfied with life as it appears; I need something more;
	- I must be the one to manufacture this MORE

What is the 'evidence' idea?
	- Show them what you mean (Show, don't tell)
	- Don't talk about it; they won't believe you

What kind of evidence is needed?
	- Photographs and video
	- Obvious
	- Hidden in plain sight

Innovative processes
--------------------------------------------------

What can I do that makes sense now?
	- Design and build a little shed with Chad and Carol
	- Hold salons with Carol, and invite our friends
	- Photograph Toronto with Ben and Liam

Are these things enough to become famous?
	- Yes. Integrate them together

What is the big idea?
	- Compassion though design
	- Living with others

What is on my bucket list?
	- Take Carol and the boys to London, Berlin and Rome, when they are mature enough to appreciate it

Do I really care about cities?

Tangibility of efforts
--------------------------------------------------

Does achievement have to be tangible?

Questions about questions

Climate change

	- High density
	- High amenity
	- Low reliance on automobiles
	- Reduced ecological footprint

Does climate change things for people that don't believe in climate change?
	- Yes. Carbon will be taxed [directly or indirectly]
	- Transportation that requires carbon will become more expensive
	- Housing that requires more utilities will become more expensive


Possessions and the form of cities
--------------------------------------------------

	- Yes, almost certainly


Vulnerable populations
--------------------------------------------------

What is the best thing to do to improve life in cities for the most vulnerable?

	- Make the tax system more progressive
	- Enable manual mode transportation systems
	- Increase the level of amenity available to all residents

What will Canadian cities look like in fifty years?
	- Better transit systems using ideas from elsewhere
	- More cyclists
	- More pedestrians
	- More varied industries downtown

Should affordable housing be tiny housing?
	- Tiny housing is a reaction to huge housing that is unfordable

Is the tiny house movement a fad or does it mean something deeper?
	- Tiny houses seem to require land
	- In most places, land is in short supply

Is it possible to build tiny houses with high density?
	- Similar to micro-condos

Density issues
--------------------------------------------------

Should all cities be the same density?
	- Is there such a thing as a too-dense city?
	- Does high-density or low-density get the worst rap?
	- Do people who prefer lower density usually have experiences with dysfunctional high-density cities?


Cultural differences between cities
--------------------------------------------------

Does every culture have its own particular idea of what makes a good city?
	- Or are there some things which are universal when it comes to urban design?


Urban design processes
--------------------------------------------------

How should cities be designed?
	- Is there a preferred method on how to design a modern city?
