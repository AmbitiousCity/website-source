	- Under attack, journalists are conceding defeat to well-oiled propaganda machines without really understanding why they're losing
	- use the same dramatic structure Hollywood screenwriters use to build movie plots. 
	- The rise of the prosecutorial method of interviewing is relatively new
	- the old way puts journalists in a defensive crouch, attacked by those who believe the media are biased, left-leaning and agenda-driven
	- use short, neutral questions that repeat the source's own words
	- Ask a closed-ended question and sources "will confirm or deny 98 percent of the time. That's the science
	- Relying on people's charity to get answers is not a good practice
	- For Rather to hold the president's wife accountable, he would have had to ask her specific questions about incidents and events--the provable facts he says he had
	- Outputting is any time you make a statement, interject a value, voice an opinion
	- Inputting is when you ask nothing but neutral, open-ended questions
	- Inputters are straight men, allowing sources to crack wise and showcase personality. "I can go into any newsroom and usually tell you who gets the best stories in the paper. It's usually the reporters with the blander personality. They're not the life of the party. They're amazingly consistent if you eavesdrop on them during interviews: You'll hear plain, neutral, bland questions. Colorless questions usually provide colorful answers
	- The question is not going to get an answer: It just hangs in the air.' This is an avowal of failure. Sam Donaldson doesn't use the question to gather information. He uses it to let...it...hang...in...the...air. 
	- His method is based on asking questions beginning with what, how, why and to a lesser degree, who, when and where. Not exactly a novel concept. 
	- "The goal of a conversation is to exchange information; the goal of an interview is to receive information."
	- The best questions, argues Sawatsky, are like clean windows. "A clean window gives a perfect view.
	- "She asked me: 'Don't you ever get bored doing the workshop over and over?' 
	- I just asked you a closed-ended question! You of all people! Let me start again, and do it properly: How do you feel about giving this workshop?
	- My answer," he says, "surprised even me."

	- Successful interviews get people to go further than they planned to go, and rarely come from a planned list of questions, even when the questions are good ones. 
	- Interviewing does not work that way. It is a dynamic process involving two basic stages. Stage 1 is planned; Stage 2 exploits the moment that Stage 1 produces, whenever and however it occurs.
	- Wallace will have established some basic points of agreement. 
	- Accountability inevitably comes out of agreement, not fireworks. It's the only practical way to get Clemens to open up and come clean.
	- Agreement does not mean reading out research or prefacing questions with statements of fact. It is using questions strategically so that the other party takes ownership of the facts. "Establish" means that Clemens states the facts himself, so he can't just deny the facts or blow them off. That way, he must stand up and confront the issues. Once this stage is reached, he is truly accountable.
