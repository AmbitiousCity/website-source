What are empirical signs that car dependency is on the wane?

Are we at peak car?

Are cities that have no private cars at all practical?

Will cities of the future have more more private cars or fewer?

Should blocks be dense all the way through?
Sheppard and Yonge has tall buildings at the corners, mid-rise building along the main streets but low density residential in the interior of the blocks. Is this normal or sustainable?

Why are some streets uglier than others?
Dufferin Street seems ugly while other ones (usually east-west ones) are attractive and support diverse business offerings.

Should cities be designed by market forces or by empirical evidence?

Do you need to come to a consensus to build a city?

Is building a brand-new city similar to revising an existing city?

Are all-new cities any good?

Is it possible to have a modern city without building any new buildings?

What does a good pedestrian system look like?
Cities tend to have lots of pedestrians. Should there be pedestrians everywhere in a city, or only in pedestrian precincts?

Heritage buildings and energy usage: which should take precedence?

Often, architects and designers like heritage buildings: they wish to maintain heritage buildings and districts. They become of interesting older buildings are replaced be newer ones, often of dubious architectural and urban quality. Cities in which little of the past is maintained tend to be uglt places. Places where care has been taken to preserve old buildings are seen as charming. They maintain some link to the past. 

There is also a desire in radically improve the energy efficiency of new buildings. If, for instance, you were interested in building to the Passive House standard then you could either renovate an existing building. These tend to be labours of love. You could go to much easier route and build a new building with the massive amounts of insulation and the new triple-glazed windows that passive house generally requires. You could rebuild and renovate an existing house to passive house standards, but it would be so much easier if you built such a house from scratch. 

Similarly, if you had a car that had bad mileage, if might be possible to renew this car so it had an efficient engine and other systems. But generally, if you want a much more efficient vehicle than the only practical route is to acquire a more efficient car (or, better yet, sell your car and buy a bicycle). 

Therefore, many people who are both supportive of heritage retention of interesting old buildings, for reasons say of memory, cultural retention and urban texture and quality are at cross-purposes with desire to dramatically increase the energy efficiency of buildings and cities in general.

Block structures are an important part of cities; is this fixed?

If you are building a new city then the block structure can be anything that you desire. 

After the Great Fire of London in 1666 they had the opportunity to change the structure but decided to keep it to it medieval patterns and switch instead from timber construction to fire-proof with brick and stone. The structure of Manhattan with set around 1770. What was built on the block changed radically from low-rise to mid-rise to high-rise but the block structure remained intact. In Manhattan, the density and type of usage changed radically, but the basic block structure remained the same, which suggests that the original plan was well-designed and able to accommodate types of change that the original planners may not have envisioned.

With sprawling suburban residential developments that may be have winding streets that discourage through traffic is there any way to improve such a structure? Say, to improve walkability? 

in other words, if you make a plan that violates some basic idea of a livable city (such as a plan that actively discourage walkability, or that makes transit planning very difficult) are you stuck with that starting point? Should you think that it is impossible to improve places that are structurally deficient, say a suburban neighborhood that makes all forms of transportation other than cars difficult.

What if incremental change in cities is not enough?

There is much talk about what an ideal city should look like. For instance, it should be compact, should have sufficient design order, should encourage alternative means of transportation beyond the car, such as public transit, cycling and walking, it should enable people to have some access to nature, should be child-friendly, etc. Many of these points are not controversial. If you were building a new city (as occasionally happens) then you would might have a clean vision how to go about it. The problem is that for most urban dwellers, the structure is set for most of their cities. There are no dramatic urban renewal schemes that alter the overall structure pf their city. There may be an opportunities for building well-designed buildings or changing the structure of new blocks, or areas under renewal. The problem is that the overall structure is set. One suddenly can't make changes the block structure, or the overall planning of the city. Much can be done to any city, however, and this is an obvious point perhaps, the overall structure of city is difficult to change without wholesale destruction of the urban fabric. 

Any analogy would be to renovating an existing house. Incremental improvements are quite easy to do. However, wholesale improvements are quite difficult. It might be possible to convert a leaky bungalow into a gleaming passive house, but as any architect will tell you, there comes a point when if the changes to the basic structure of too great, then it is usually easier, cheaper and technically advantageous just to build a new house using more modern techniques.

If you need a new, much more efficient car, you don't attempt to renovate your existing vehicle. You might be able to improve it slightly but to make really dramatic improvements - the ones that people nught find interesting and consequential then you get another much more efficient vehicle.

Contract this with 

By the same reasoning, cities might be built in a way that make transit support very difficult, at densities that are waste resources. People want change to their cities, but they don't want destructive improvements that raze whole neighbourhoods. Urban renewal based on new ideas that are thought to radically transform have been thoroughly discredited unless the area is obviously undeveloped, underutilized, unloved, or dysfunctional.

If the change required ti improve cities cannot be change with incremental that may take generations to implement in a neighborhoods. If incremental improvements are all that is politically and practically available tp entertain, yet the improvements, in say performance required demand more than incremental change, what should be done?



Older Questions and Issues
..................................................

Q: are some questions better than others?
	- H: yes
	- http://ajrarchive.org/article.asp?id=676
	- Under attack, journalists are conceding defeat to well-oiled propaganda machines without really understanding why they're losing
	- use the same dramatic structure Hollywood screenwriters use to build movie plots. 
	- The rise of the prosecutorial method of interviewing is relatively new
	- the old way puts journalists in a defensive crouch, attacked by those who believe the media are biased, left-leaning and agenda-driven
	- use short, neutral questions that repeat the source's own words
	- Ask a closed-ended question and sources "will confirm or deny 98 percent of the time. That's the science
	- Relying on people's charity to get answers is not a good practice
	- For Rather to hold the president's wife accountable, he would have had to ask her specific questions about incidents and events--the provable facts he says he had
	- Outputting is any time you make a statement, interject a value, voice an opinion
	- Inputting is when you ask nothing but neutral, open-ended questions
	- Inputters are straight men, allowing sources to crack wise and showcase personality. "I can go into any newsroom and usually tell you who gets the best stories in the paper. It's usually the reporters with the blander personality. They're not the life of the party. They're amazingly consistent if you eavesdrop on them during interviews: You'll hear plain, neutral, bland questions. Colorless questions usually provide colorful answers
	- The question is not going to get an answer: It just hangs in the air.' This is an avowal of failure. Sam Donaldson doesn't use the question to gather information. He uses it to let...it...hang...in...the...air. 
	- His method is based on asking questions beginning with what, how, why and to a lesser degree, who, when and where. Not exactly a novel concept. 
	- "The goal of a conversation is to exchange information; the goal of an interview is to receive information."
	- The best questions, argues Sawatsky, are like clean windows. "A clean window gives a perfect view.
	- "She asked me: 'Don't you ever get bored doing the workshop over and over?' 
	- I just asked you a closed-ended question! You of all people! Let me start again, and do it properly: How do you feel about giving this workshop?
	- My answer," he says, "surprised even me."

	- Successful interviews get people to go further than they planned to go, and rarely come from a planned list of questions, even when the questions are good ones. 
	- Interviewing does not work that way. It is a dynamic process involving two basic stages. Stage 1 is planned; Stage 2 exploits the moment that Stage 1 produces, whenever and however it occurs.
	- Wallace will have established some basic points of agreement. 
	- Accountability inevitably comes out of agreement, not fireworks. It's the only practical way to get Clemens to open up and come clean.
	- Agreement does not mean reading out research or prefacing questions with statements of fact. It is using questions strategically so that the other party takes ownership of the facts. "Establish" means that Clemens states the facts himself, so he can't just deny the facts or blow them off. That way, he must stand up and confront the issues. Once this stage is reached, he is truly accountable.


Q: are there different types of questions?
	- H: yes

Q: what are good resources on questions?
	- online: John Sawatsky's work on questions
	- paper: A Theory of Questions and Question Asking (bibdesk)
	- paper: Asking generative design questions (bibdesk)

Q: do questions lead to design?
Q: do you acquire some understanding just by asking questions?
Q: is asking a question, without providing an immediate answer, worthwhile?

Q: What is a good way to generate good questions systematically?
	- H: walk around the city and take photographs
 
Q: What are non-questions?
	I: other entities like facts, observations, hypotheses and ideas
	I: things are don't demand an action or response
	I: ones that can easily be dismissed as irrelevant 

Q: Are good design questions really 'neutral'?

Q: Are questions connected together into stories? [see Sawatsky] 
	I: micro: asking good questions
	I: macro: getting good stories

Q: what should questions achieve?
	H: invite a response
	H: gather good information
	H: be read by many who understand what it means
	H: get information from some source
	H: be focused
	H: be enduring
