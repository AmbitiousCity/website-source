Questions - Samples
==================================================

:summary: Questions written to learn how to write questions 2

We believe
--------------------------------------------------

- creative solutions require creative questions
- implicit in any good design is a good question


Strategy
--------------------------------------------------

- DO LESS. But do it well.
- people don't want analysis. They want creative IDEAS and beautiful pictures
- ask good questions, but also offer SOLUTIONS to good questions
- people like humour; the person behind the pen
- give people something they couldn't do on their own (e.g. architectural and urban design)


Bylines
--------------------------------------------------

"simple questions inspire creative ideas"
"there are more good ideas out there than you might think"
"simple questions often show how little we know"
"you need both analysis and creativity to build a city"

- analytical (questions/evidence) + creative (forms)


Questions = Blog post title
--------------------------------------------------

Specialty of Ambitious City => possible, conceivable, creative urban forms
	- fun, creative, plausible, beautiful, semi-professional...
	- good ideas should result in new urban forms
	- basic forms, more basic ideas of how to live, or work

Urban forms for the future
	- If you don't want to live in a high-rise (and can't afford a detached home) what might be a good way to live?
	- Why do most new buildings look very similar?
	- Will all existing urban forms be replaced, surrounded or backgrounded by new urban forms?

The culture of eco-friendly design
	- Why is eco-friendly housing usually done in the countryside? Why not high density in the city?

Change to basic urban forms (what would Baron Haussmann do?)
	- what to do with major streets that have very low destiny and uses unsuitable for their current use? (eg. Dufferin, Bathurst)

Manhattanization and densification
	- Is Manhattanization inevitable (high density replacing lower density)?
	- given that high-rise residential is the most common form being built, is there any way to make them more livable?
	- Is it possible to build a city that won't undergo Manhattanization?
	- Should Manhattanization be avoided (by building cities at optimal density at the beginning?)

Cars and density of cities
	- Can you build a city without cars - but with low density? Does that make sense?
	- What would cities look like if all cars disappeared tomorrow?

Transferability of urban forms
	- Are all architectural/urban issues local?
	- Should ethnic groups bring their urban forms (as well as their food) when they immigrate?

- blog post
- photo (illustrating a point)
- question (related to photo)
- references
- Sketchup form

Specialty
--------------------------------------------------

All concern:
- ideas that spring from reasoning and evidence
- overall architectural form and organization of buildings and neighbourhoods

Main concerns:
- reasoning, evidence and creativity
- sustainability
- livability
- beauty
- people-oriented design (as opposed to car-oriented) [implicit]
- density [implicit]


What is this all about?
--------------------------------------------------

- design without a client
- freelance urban design
- integrating blogging (writing) with urban form design
- integration of my talents and gifts
