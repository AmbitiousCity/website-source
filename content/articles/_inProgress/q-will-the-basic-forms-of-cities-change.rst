:summary: Will the basic forms of cities change?

Are you stuck with the basic street patterns and overall configuration of a city, or are there opportunities to change it? 

It is a good idea to work within the pattern that history has provided, or should people think about new structures that might be better configurations?

What if a city wanted to narrow or widen its streets slightly? Or make the standard building lot size more compact? SHould history provide a guide to what to do next, or should each section of the city if it is about to be developed be a blank slate that demands new attentions to current requirements and norms?
