What is a good strategy?

Climate change is a global disruptor. It is what Uber taxi-haling app is to the taxi industry, but applied to cities across the globe. Places where millions of people currently live. The disruption is so great and the cost so high that it will inspire and require great levels of human ingenuity to survive. 

- don't build new cities in low-lying areas on the ocean.
- tell people in vulnerable cities what to expect in their children's lifetime (or sooner)
- identify where the ocean waters will rise to given a rise of one or two meters. 
- think about how your city will get fresh water if supply is limited and non-renewable.
- investigate how to cool cities using natural means (ocean or lake water, or natural breezes?)
- assume that the shape of cities will change substantially, in climate threats become severe. 
- investigate the idea floating cities that are adaptable to rising sea-levels.

We are at the stage of accepting that global warming is real and happening now. There have been little discussion about how to retrofit our cities to accommodate this warming. 

Cities without water may find that to be a great limiting factor to their future development and survival. They way want to relocate where there is more water. Cities built in deserts such as Los Angeles and Las Vegas may find this difficult. 

Low-lying cities on the oceans will find to very expensive to protect themselves against rising sea-water. It is unclear whether rising tide barriers such as those found in the Netherlands are feasible. It may be possible to protect cities, but may be impractical to protect the countries adjacent to the cities. Miami or Amsterdam might be salvageable; south Florida or Holland may not be.  

Storms are increasing in severity in many locales. Water gain ins a problem.

Places that are really hot may become much hotter. 

In Ontario, where I live we seems less under threat than other places. We are not on the ocean so rising sea-water is not a concern. There is plenty of fresh water. If temperatures rise a few degrees is would mean that summers are a bit warmer but that winters are more bearable.
