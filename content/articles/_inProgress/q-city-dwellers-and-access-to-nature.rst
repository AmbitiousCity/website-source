Research has shown that city dwellers benefit from exposure to nature. Cities vary greatly in the exposure to nature they provide to residents. Some cities are quite green while others only grudgingly provide access to nature to people living the densest parts of the city. 

Cities where nature is accessible to residents are more pleasant than ones where nature is far-removed. People are living in bigger cities. 

More and more people are living in cities. Cities are becoming larger and larger. Despite becoming increasingly urbanized, people still need nature. 

Cities have become so large and encompassing, that one can't easily escape to the country -- assuming there exists a hinterland one might want to escape to where nature thrives. 

Some cities are fortunate to have parks where nature can be experienced. Many cities have lacked the foresight to build such areas. Once buildings have spread everywhere, it is difficult to carve out a Central Park or Tiergarten after the fact.

If larger parks are hard to retrofit into existing cities, what can cities do to bring nature to their residents? 


Some cities are planned with protected parkland while others do without. Modern cities tend to be dense, tall and overpowering. The modern city tends not to where nature thrives.
