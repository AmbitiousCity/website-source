Research has shown that city dwellers benefit from exposure to nature. Cities vary greatly in the exposure to nature they provide to residents. Some cities are quite green while others only grudgingly provide access to nature to people living the densest parts of the city. Some cities are planned with protected parkland while others do without. Modern cities tend to be dense, tall and overpowering. This makes provision of nature difficult.
