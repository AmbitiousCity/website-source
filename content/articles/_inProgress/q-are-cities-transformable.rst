:summary: Can cities change enough to survive into the future? Or, is it better to see our current cities are disposable experiments in viability, which might work out or might not?




One of the biggest threats to many cities today is climate change. This is a severe problem of great concern to many. 

The diagnosis of the problem as well as the suitability of various solutions is heavily politicized. We hope that science can help us and that international research and policy agendas will help deal with the situation. We may or may not be confident that researchers and politicians working globally will be able to figure anything out in time.  

What is alarming as that change is happening quickly: cities access to water is in decline, some suffer great storms, some have rising waters. Some will soon be uninhabitable. However, the effect is not uniform. Some cities suffer a great deal while others no so much. Some seems to have political structures in place to address difficult ecological problems. Many, do very little and lack the political or cultural infrastructure to meaningfully address difficult problems. 

This has happened in the past. Cities have ceased to be viable for climate change or other ecological reasons.  The earth's surface is littered with abandoned cities often centers for sophisticated cultures. When we read that Miami and a host of other coastal cities will soon be underwater.  

Assuming that there arises a scientific and technical consensus of climate change, what then should cities do to address this consensus? 

People in Miami might read the report and say OK, we need to raise the city, or need to move the city, or perhaps abandon the city completely. We need to do this in a hundred years or less. Some might say that Miami is a great city and it's a shame that it didn't work out but why not just build another Miami like city onto higher ground that isn't right next to the ocean? Other would say that we need to spend whatever it takes to defend Miami because to lose it is to lose something very valuable. 

Triage

Do you transform a city as much as it takes to survive the new climate regime or do you triage: Some cities will survive whatever we do. Some will die no matter what we attempt, while others can survive but only if we diagnosis their problems very quickly and do exactly what is required to enable the city to survive -- much like in a hospital ER or on the battlefield.
