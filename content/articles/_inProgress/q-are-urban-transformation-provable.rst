:summary: Can the transformations of cities be proved?

Say, you assume that cities must change for various reasons: for address climate change, to improve a transit system so people can get to work efficiently, to house people so they afford to live in the city and also work there, etc. All this is saying is that the status quo is all respects is not viable, or acceptable: some things must change to make the city viable. 

Some would argue that we need to do x to address y. FOr example, We must build bicycle paths, or build dams to counter rising waters, or start building rental housing in adequate quantities. Say you had a set of committees who all wanted to do various things to improve in the city and assume that you didn't have much time to do the right thing. 

Could you list all these ideas into a big ordered lists of things that you could connect from the presente to another point (say, before the waters rise to destroy the city). 

Use case:

Put all the things in a big list 
Put them in order (a must come bfore b, before c, etc)
Show how each one would connect with the other and lead to the other. 

Decomposiitons

Problems facing cities are too large to fix in one go. Some people may have great skills in building the dike around the whole city, but can't focus on other problems such as how to deal with transit while the dike is being built, or how to house the workers who are building the dike. You want to solve a huge problem by pursuing several smaller sub-problems. You want to decompose the problem into smaller bits.
