:summary: Can on-demand autonomous vehicles be applied to other things in cities?


We have been told that we are soon to be in the age of self-driving automatics vehicles. Google and Apple will soon become prominent car-makers. This rumor has sprung much sooner than anticipated. 

Car in our cities spend a lot of time not doing anything. Most cars in cities are parked and are not doing anything useful. There is huge cost for all these parked cars. A self-driving car could in theory never need to park. It could be working 24 hours a day. One could own a self-driving car, take to work in the morning and then send it out to work to earn its keep until the owner needed to get a ride home. Once home the owner to send it out again to work all night long. This could easily be a money-earner for its owner, assuming the autonomous vehicle doesn't break down, gets hijacked, or mows down a sidewalk full of little kids. 

This behavior could be built into the car when bought. The insurance could also be purchased at the smae time (the type of insurance that UberX drivers will soon need to purchase). Motoring will turn from a terrible but perhaps necessary non-recoverable expense: a transportation tax that people must pay if they live in community without public transit or bike lanes, into a useful little earner that provides public- accessible transit without public investment.  

It may take a while to get the software just right but the business model is clear. Cites need autonomous vehicles much more than they think that they do and they could solve a host of urban transportation problems quickly with great efficiency. 

The on-demand idea can also be applied to other things in the city. If people could use but not own vehicle, such as people increasingly use, but not own music (by way of music streaming). Could this idea be applied to buildings. People want to use a space, an office that is a rental hotel, a warehouse that is rentable on-demand. a opo-up shoo that is usable for a short time but isn't owned by its renters. How about a house that is actually a hotel. It looks like a regular house but is actually not your house. It is just rented for a fixed period. 

The ideas:

- cities are cannot afford vehicles that just sit around empty most of the time. These vehicles take up valuable space, are expensive to park and do not earn any revenue for their owners while they sit empty. 
- self-driving or autonomous cars could alleviate much congestion in cities and provide novel revenue streams for vehicle owners.

- This on-demand idea could be applied to buildings aw well. Office hotels are well-known in which people can come and go and get work done in well-serviced spaces. Could the idea apply to places where people live? Might city residential accommodation be made more affordable if more than one family shared the same place? This takes the 'hot-bunking idea' to. You wouldn't need as many places to live if people occupied the same places, but at different times of the day. While you are at work, then another family could be doing the same things are you do, but at a different time slot. 


Factors to consider:

- If you lend out to car to spend its day ferrying strangers around town then you would want to depersonalize your car and take out all personal and valuable items that are not bolted down. The same with your house: if strangers may enter it the moment you leave and go to work, then you will need to secure things that are not bolted down. As soon as you enter your house your personal items will have to magically appear once they sense you are home to appreciate them. 

- if you rent out your car for the day then you will need to know that your car will be available at the exact time you need it to pick you up at the end of the day. You should be able to specify the risk of having to wait for it paying customer have finished their journeys. Similarly, if you rent out your hose for the day, you will need to specify how much you need to go to you home. It is possible that people will not car where they end up sleeping so long as they can sleep somewhere that night. You might own a place to live, but your lifestyle may be similar to global travelers who spend most of their time in hotels. For most, this would not be an acceptable lifestyle, but fro some they may be living that way already.
