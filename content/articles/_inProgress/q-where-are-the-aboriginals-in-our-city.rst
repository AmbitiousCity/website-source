- if things progressed and things got better, what would be a good way to raise the profile of native population in Toronto?

- should people be able to go to a part of town which has a native aspect to it?
- where do natives live?
- do they live in one part of town?
- if there was no racism would their profile in the community change?

- is invisibility a sign of integration (sim Germans or the Dutch)

- no languages on the street, what do they sound like?
- should it be a part of town?
- should be there be a place where they congregate?
- should the culture have an urban design aspect
- Aboriginals are seen as a rural rather than urban population
- this is a lost opportunity

- institutions I know about:
- Native Canadian Centre of Toronto. 16 Spadina Rd, Toronto, http://ncct.on.ca/
- Native Child and Family Services of Toronto, 30 College Street, Toronto, http://www.nativechild.org/

One of the oddities of living in Toronto is that the aboriginal communities, called First Nations in Canada, are largely invisible. Canada has a not especially proud history in its relationships ot First Nations peoples, especially noteworthy is the history of residential schools, 


There are almost 40,000 people of aboriginal descent living here [#first]_ but you may not know it. 

 This land on which Toronto is built was, and probably still is the territory of the Huron-Wendat and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. 

There are some beautiful buildings that serve the First Nations communities including this one [#second]_ but there are no neighbourhoods that spring to mind in which these communities might live. 

This is quite surprising considering that the entire city is built on aboriginal land and 



Toronto is known for it so-called ethnic neighbourhoods, settled by immigrants groups over time. Many of these still maintain an original ethnic flavour. 

Many other non-native ethnic groups have parts of town named after them. There are several Chinatowns, a couple of Little Italy's, a Greektown, etc. These are popular parts of town filled with busy bars, restaurants and food markets. Torontonians are justly proud of these ethnic neighbourhoods since they add quite much character to its urban fabric.

But their is no Huron-Wendat Town here, no Iroqoius Village where you migh go to hear Iroquoian Languages such as Mohawk, or Ojibwe languages.

If you go to Chinatown you all likely to see stores signs written in Chinese script and to hear Mandarin and Cantonese spoken on the street. Where do you go in Toronto to hear 

Ethnic communities usually form because newcomers to the city find it easier to survive in the city when their community is nearby. Certainly, First Nations peoples need support from their community to survive in a city like Toronto, like every other community. 

This invisibility of First Nations communities in the urban context is one of the oddities of Toronnto urban life. Where are they, what are the forces that keep them hidden, what would Toronto look like if they were more visible, how can Canada go beyond this blind sport of monumental proportions in our national self-image?

However, on the First Nations front the urban nature of aboriginal population is indeed paltry. The author John Lorinc discusses this in some depth in his excellent book.
