	In the design and marketing of condos the emphasis is on privacy and exclusivity, the kind that can lead to social isolation. Do all condo dwellers really like all this privacy and exclusivity or would they prefer just a bit more community-building features in the design of their buildings? 

In Toronto these days a huge condo construction boom is taking place. Often these condo towers are reasonably attractive, built with modern materials and bold colour schemes. Yet, other than the fact that may have convenient downtown locations, they often seem like socially isolating places to live. Residents walk into their lobby, get into an elevator, get off on their floor and then scurry along an interior corridor to their unit. There seems to be little opportunity to interact with their neighbours. The social realm tends not be celebrated in such developments. 

In design and marketing of condos the emphasis is on privacy and exclusivity, the kind that can lead to social isolation. Do all condo dwellers really like all this privacy and exclusivity or would they prefer just a bit more community-building features in the design of their buildings? 

In many European or Asian residential building types there are often semi-public courtyard spaces that can be socially engaging and spatially rewarding. These spaces provide a way of interacting with your neighbours in a way that acknowledges that you live together in the same building and thus are not total strangers. Such spaces don't demand you interact with your neighbours, they just make interactions more likely. 

In condos, collective spaces are often limited to lobbies, which are sometimes quite lavish and impressive. But lobbies tend not to be places where you can spend too much time; people pass through them quickly. They function more as security checkpoints than as social venues. 

One social aspect of condo buildings that tends to be over-emphasized in condo billboards is the outstanding social amenity that their roof decks promise their residents. These ads suggest impressive levels of luxury and exclusivity on these decks: cocktails on the lounge, barbecues with your closest friends, with amazing views of the city below. A nice roof deck in the downtown core of Toronto can indeed provide good times but I suspect such promises of conviviality are overblown; they suggest a level of social interaction that seldom takes place. 

Compare this with the modern open offices that well-funded tech startups often inhabit. These are purposively designed to encourage informal social interaction like that found at water coolers or the new espresso machine. The goal is for the office to become a place to exchange ideas and build group cohesion, which is so important for creative and knowledge-based pursuits. But there doesn't seem to be an equivalent to the water cooler in a condo. No one seems to spend too much time designing interesting social interactions that might take place within them.
