We live in an age dominated by news of the Syrian civil war. As far as civil wars goes it is one of the worst. Syrians are escaping a conflict in which dozens of warring factions, including their own government, are fighting a pitiless war. It is hard for anyone to keep all the sides straight. The usual rules like an enemy of enemy is a friend do not apply. Western politicians in particular tend to do a poor job of explaining who is fighting whom, and why.

Our country and city will soon accept thousands of refugees. Official government policy is now to welcome them and to treat them (after screening) as genuine refugees. This is controversial in some quarters, but after the latest election results in Canada opponents are not in a position to object too strongly. We expect the refugees will indeed be warmly welcomed.

Many Syrian refugees will be traumatized for having to leave their beloved country. We can't assume that they would prefer to relocate to Germany, Norway or Canada if they weren't forced to do so because of this war. Even if they are warmly welcomed to a foreign country, it is still a foreign country.

Refugees tend to be happy to be alive despite their dislocation. Syrian refugees are likely to be resourceful and entrepreneurial. Since they are escaping a total war, Syrian refugees form a diverse crowd. They are escaping--much like Iraqis before them--from a society that until quite recently enjoyed relatively high standards of living and of social development.

In Canada, as in all others, the emotional journey from being a possibly traumatized refugee to a well-integrated member of society is a long and arduous one. Syrians may not find all aspects of Canadian life to be superior or gratifying, but the country should be able to offer security, stability and possibly, opportunity.

Eventually, the civil war in Syria will end. Clearly, the political landscape of the Middle East as designed and partitioned by western powers after WWI is completely broken. The sectarianism that has exploded in the region must end. There may be great changes afoot for countries like Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Israel. The world has seen the complete chaos caused by externally-funded proxy wars and doesn't like what it sees. 

Historically, the Middle East has been a crossroads of civilizations. When politicians talk of a 'clash of civilizations' one can safely assume they understand little about such things. Damascus, Jerusalem and Baghdad were once glorious, multi-ethnic, cosmopolitan cities. We trust that they will once again be able to continue their often-interrupted status as true centers of civilization, despite how counter-intuitive that proposition may seem under the current circumstances.
