Research has shown that city dwellers benefit from |exposure to nature|. The health benefits of exposure are real and quantifiable. Access to nature will soon be seen as a basic human right, the type of issue over which lawsuits will soon be filed. What can cities do to improve access to nature for their residents?

There are two issues here: access and exposure. You might have great access to nature, but still get little exposure. Exposing yourself to nature is like going to the gym: many think about doing it, far fewer actually do it. 

Living in a dense city is a |green thing to do|, although it might not feel that way when walking the mean streets of most cities. Cities vary widely in the amount of access to nature they provide their residents. Some cities are suburban or semi-rural in character. Here, access to nature may not be a problem. Some cities are built in places where much of the land is unbuildable, such as Rio or Pittsburgh. In these cities green space may be visible from many parts of town but still not accessible to residents. Some cities are fortunate to have large centralized parks such as Central Park, the Tiergarten or the Bois de Boulogne. These tend to be excellent places to escape. Yet, many cities lacked the foresight to build such parks. They may not have anticipated a future in which their city expanded exponentially. Large parks are difficult to retrofit into existing cities. Few places are fortunate enough to have a visionary landscape architect like |Frederick Law Olmsted| in their past.

What are some ideas for cities to improve access to nature for their residents?

Create pedestrian routes though existing nature
	To derive a benefit from nature it is important that people not just look at it but also walk through it. The best way to commute to work is to walk through nature. Few cities are designed to encourage this basic human behavior. Cities with systems of linear parkland or service rights-of-way should consider whether these can be used as walker commuter routes. 

View underused land as potential parkland
	Many cities have vacant or underused land that could potentially be converted into parkland.

Make existing parks more usable and attractive
	You often see parks that are underused because of the heavy traffic adjacent to them. Traffic calming near parkland should become a priority. 

Provide noise barriers along busy highways
	Car-dependent societies often lavish great resources in building elaborate highway systems. Near these roadways are often natural spaces that are difficult to enjoy because of traffic noise and emissions. If |noise barriers| (preferably transparent ones) were installed where highways and parkland coincide, traffic noise could be significantly reduced. Noise reduction significantly increases the value of properties |marginalized by traffic noise|. 

Turn vacant lots into mini, perhaps temporary, parks
	Cities often have vacant lots that for various reasons are unoccupied by buildings.  It is usually a good idea to fill in these empty spaces with new buildings in order to strengthen urban form and promote densification. When this is not preferred |vest-pocket parks| can sometimes add great amenity to a city.

Require green space additions to new buildings
	Most cities (especially in North America) are strict about parking requirements for new buildings. They are much less strict about requirements to add urban green space. Cities should require that all new buildings provide usable green space in some non-specified configuration. It shouldn't matter how small each green plot is, so long as when they are all added together they make a difference. Even when a new building is a high-rise there is potential to increase urban green space, if one thinks slightly outside the box (see below).

Encourage green roofs on all new buildings
	If you look over any city one notices the vast acreage of rooftops. A rooftop garden or patio gives one a new perspective on the city. The structures of existing and new buildings should be designed to handle the increased loads that come with green roofs and rooftop gardens. 

Encourage parks in the sky for new buildings
	Tall buildings need not be monolithic. The same technology that enable them to be tall can also be used to make indentations or projections to accommodate roof gardens. This is often seen in |futuristic visions| of green cities. It remains a promising idea.

Encourage under-used high-rise balconies to be converted into green spaces
	Many tall residential buildings have balconies. Typically, these balconies are seldom used because the experience of being out on them is unpleasant. Why not convert these balconies into tiny greenhouses or other green spaces?

Encourage mini-gardens in existing housing units
	Nature can come in all different sizes. It need not be a physical space to walk through. It can also be something tiny to observe or meditate upon. The most sophisticated version of this idea are the tiny courtyard gardens, or |tsuboniwa|, found in traditional Japanese houses. You don't need a lot of nature to bring something truly natural into your daily life.
