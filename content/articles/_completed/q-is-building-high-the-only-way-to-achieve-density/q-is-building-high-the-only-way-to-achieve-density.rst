Toronto is currently experiencing a vertical building boom. Three and four story buildings are being replaced by high-rises, some of which are eighty stories tall. This increases the density of the city, which has many advantages including compactness and reduced services costs. For instance, locating people near existing transit hubs saves building new transit lines, which many governments are reluctant or incapable of providing. However, not everyone likes the idea of a Manhattan or Hong Kong lifestyle if they are used to a much lower density.

High-rises depend on elevators, yet many cities developed before their invention. Prior to elevators people had to walk up stairs. The maximum height that people were willing to walk up was about five or six stories. The European pattern was to achieve density by blanketing the city with large blocks that are five or six stories tall, accessible (in theory) without elevators. Often there are courtyards in the middle of these blocks. This approach greatly reduces sprawl but depends on a type of top-down planning and development control foreign to more market-driven locales.

In North America the pattern is quite different. In most places, people are used to low-density environments. Often they desire to have direct access to the ground and to have on-property parking for their cars. The idea of large perimeter walk-up blocks common to European cities is foreign to them. Here, the spaces between buildings and outdoor spaces are generous (though, often under-utilized) and the number of floors to be climbed without an elevator are few. It is not a bad pattern--especially if you like the idea of your own landscaped property--yet, it usually is a recipe for sprawl. Sprawl creates collective pain, but within the context of private comfort and privilege. In Europe it's the collective needs that tend to be emphasized, while in North America it's the private ones.

How to achieve density is a hot topic for a city like Toronto but seldom do you see proposals for building European-style perimeter blocks with interior courtyards like you might see in Paris in Berlin. Instead, high-rises are seen as the way to go. High-rises have the advantage of not having to assemble block-size parcels: you can build on tiny plots of land. There is usually little regulatory objection to the replacement of low-density development with high-rises, unless it takes place within established residential neighbourhoods. In the downtown core in Toronto there appears to be hundreds or even thousands of suitable sites for high-rises. Often, there is little existing urban context left to protect; a gleaming new high-rise is often seen as an improvement over the status quo. A little slice of ersatz Manhattan may be preferable to an existing parking lot.

In Toronto's downtown core you tend to see two patterns: first, some very tall residential building with impressive residential densities, and second, low-density legacy neighbourhoods, many of which are very attractive, yet still have densities too low to reduce sprawl. If these older neighbourhoods are high-status enough, then they are under no immediate threat of significant densification. What seems to be missing here is the middle ground: buildings that are medium density in which people might not need adopt a *Blade Runner-like* lifestyle all at once.
