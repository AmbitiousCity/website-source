:summary: One interesting aspect of autonomous cars is their potential to always be in motion and possibly function as autonomous taxi services. If they worked well they might have the power to transform transportation in cities. 


We have been told that self-driving autonomous vehicles will soon arrive. Some believe Google and Apple will become prominent car-makers. This, at first sounds far-fetched. You would think that it would be difficult to get the software for these vehicles just right. However, they seemed to have figured it well enough to send out test vehicles that roam our streets right now. One aspect that seems interesting with these vehicles is their potential to always be in motion. If autonomous vehicles worked well they might have the power to transform transportation in cities. 

Most cars in our cities spend a lot of time parked. With a parked car, or a lot full of parked cars, the cars just sit there doing nothing, waiting for their owners to use them again. This might occur hours or days later. What a colossal waste of resources and of scarce urban space. Wouldn't it be a better idea if cars didn't park at all and lead more productive, and perhaps, profitable lives?

For example, you could own a self-driving car, take it to work in the morning and then send it out to work to earn its keep until you needed it to take you home at the end of the day. Once you arrived home you could then send it out to work all night long. It could be working 24 hours a day. It doesn't need rest like a dray-horse or its human owner. All it really needs is fuel and maintenance. With this freelance taxi model, when you buy an autonomous vehicle you could also acquire a potential revenue stream. Your vehicle becomes, in effect, part of a private-owned but publicly-accessible transit system.

Payment and insurance systems required
	Vehicles for this idea would need software and hardware to accept payments. However, this technical issue seems relatively minor compared to the challenge of getting an autonomous vehicle to actually drive around a city safely on its own. Systems would need to be in place to ensure that people don't catch rides and not pay for them and that everyone, including the public, is suitably insured.

Autonomous would really mean autonomous
	Self-driving cars today typically have someone at the ready to take over in case the vehicle runs amok. Cars that operate as autonomous taxi services could not depend on anyone taking over--say, a drunken carload of revelers being ferried to the next bar. The vehicle would have to do it all, including refueling, finding directions, avoiding hazards and thieves, dealing with fare-cheats and calling ambulances.

No parked cars means no parking lots
	Parking lots do little for most cities. The space in cities should be too valuable to waste on parked cars. Autonomous vehicles in constant motion would need people in them going places rather than driving around empty. You would have to balance supply and demand closely. We expect that the added efficiency of vehicles being in constant motion could make a big difference in how our cities work.

Substitutability of vehicles
	If you start renting out your private vehicle to strangers then this could become a common cultural practice. People wouldn't care whose car they are driving in so long as they can get to where they are going. If your own car is busy when you want to go home then you can always just take someone else's and let your own car continue working. Vehicles become part of an on-demand service. You might care little about what a vehicle says about your tastes or perceived status. You will desire comfort, safety and economy from a vehicle, but that's about it. This commodification of transportation should help cities: cars then just become a way of getting around town and little more.
