	Would laneway construction be a creative and ultimately beneficial disruption of the city or an inefficient use of scarce municipal resources?

Many North American cities have systems of laneways which run parallel to the normal street patterns. Given that lots sizes are generous in many places and that land is a scarce resource in downtown cores, people naturally are clamoring to build in laneways. They constitute a huge underutilized land inventory.

Many people would love to build in laneways because they would could provide an attractive, central, alternative, or even counter-cultural place to live. They would also involve interesting design challenges of building on small lots with tight clearances and non-traditional neighbours. Often, they are well-served by existing transit lines. In Toronto's downtown core there are many laneways. Some have stylish, architect-designed houses built on them, but most have marginal structures such as sheds and uninsulated garages intended to live their days in obscurity. One of Toronto's charms is that these two types of buildings often lie adjacent to one another: gentrification has been extensive but it is not yet total.

Cities are often be reluctant to allow widespread laneway development since that would require they provide municipal services along these laneways. Typically, services such as water, electricity and snow-plowing are accessible from one side only--from the street side--rather than behind in the laneway. Therefore, there is a collective interest in whether to allow people to build in them: it would involve a re-allocation of municipal resources since laneways builders would expect the city to step up and provide some of the standard municipal services that normal street dwellers receive. 

If servicing costs (that might be born by the city as whole) were not an issue then the question arises what a city might look like if all laneways were built upon? Would it make the city more attractive, functional or interesting? [I think it probably would]. Or--being devil's advocate here--would it mean that scarce municipal resources are allocated to a relatively privileged part of society--those  who are well-off enough to consider building detached residences in laneways, but not so well-off that they can afford the sky-high costs of available street-side properties?
