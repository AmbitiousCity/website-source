Why ask questions about urban design? 
-----------------------------------------------------

We believe that cities benefit from good design. Design is a conscious activity that also evolves over time. We believe that implicit in any good design is a good question. We see asking questions as part of a early design phase, which we consider as the most important phase of design. During early design basic orientations and conceptual framing takes places that influences later stages of design.

Questions are useful in that they:

- encourage curiosity about the nature of the city
- define what we don't know
- can lead to many good ideas
- provide a *structure* for good ideas: a good idea is given a context by the question that inspires it. 

What makes a good question?
--------------------------------------------------

It is one that:

- when asked makes a situation clearer or more understandable
- re-frames perception in an interesting way
- is possible to answer--after a finite amount of research or reflection
- is neither too broad nor too narrow
- encourages a process of learning to determine what its answer might be
- is non-rhetorical--should uncover something that in unknown, as opposed to a statement the promotes an established position or opinion
