Why attempt to ask good questions about urban design? 
-----------------------------------------------------

- Good questions are important because they encourage curiosity
- Good questions can lead to many good ideas
- Questions also provide a *structure* for good ideas: a good idea is given a context by the question that inspires it. 

What makes a good question?
--------------------------------------------------

It is one that:
..................................................

- when asked makes a situation clearer or more understandable
- re-frames perception in an interesting way
- encourages a process of learning to determine what its answer might be
- is non-rhetorical--should uncover something that in unknown, as opposed to a statement the promotes an established position or opinion 
- is possible to answer--after a finite amount of research or reflection
- is neither too broad nor too narrow
