Why attempt to ask good questions about urban design? 
-----------------------------------------------------

- Good questions are important because they encourage curiosity
- Questions can lead to many ideas
- Questions also provide a *structure* for good ideas: a good idea is given a context by the question that may have inspired it. 

What makes a good question?
--------------------------------------------------

- One that is neither too broad nor too narrow
- One that 'cuts to the chase'
- One, that when asked, makes a situation clearer or more understandable 
- One to which preliminary answers are available without expending a huge amount of effort

What makes a good question?
--------------------------------------------------


It is:
..................................................

- clear what the question means, or to which it refers

- possible to answer - after some finite amount of research or reflection
- non-rhetorical: a question should be used to uncover something that in unknown, as opposed to a statement the promotes an established position or opinion


It should:
..................................................

- have an answer that isn't obvious, or given
- inspire some curiosity to find its answer
- increase our understanding of the world if an answer to it is found
- re-frame existing reality in an interesting way
