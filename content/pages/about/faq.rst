:summary: Frequently asked questions


------

Where did this idea come from?
	It came from the insight that good questions appear to be more enduring than most answers. A good question can last forever whereas an answer needs to be revised to keep up with changing circumstances. It also came from study in how to represent design knowledge.

------

Isn't all this really academic and irrelevant?
	No, we believe it is interesting, relevant and will lead to cool urban design ideas. 

------

Aren't all questions the same?
	No, we think there is such a thing as a good question, which brings clarity to a situation. We hope to define exactly what these are. Clarity, we believe, encourages creativity. 

------

Aren't answers more interesting and useful than questions?
	Yes, usually, but answers depend on some preceding question. This question might be implied or hidden, but it still there. We figure that if you go back far enough you end up at a top-level question, not an answer. We also see knowledge as a provisional or temporary scaffolding that requires you examine how you got to where you are.

------

What does this have to do with design?
	Designers and all other creatives must ask a lot of questions before they begin to design interesting things. In our experience the quality of questions makes a big difference to the quality of results. Good designers tend to ask good questions.  

------

Do all designers think this way?
	No.

------

But are questions really *design*?
	Maybe not, but how you frame a design problem is lot more important than most people think.

------

Ambitious City claims to be about collaborative urban design processes, yet the site appears to be written by one person. How do you justify that?
	We're working on it.
