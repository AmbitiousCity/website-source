Michael Cumming is the founder of Ambitious City. He is a writer, designer and photographer. He has an architectural degree from Dalhousie University in Halifax and a Ph.D. in Computational Design from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He spent many years in architectural experience in Canada and the UK and some years in academia where he taught design, researched and presented papers at international design conferences. His research was mostly on the topic of distributed, knowledge-based design processes. He now applies these ideas to the design of cites, which he sees as the one of the most important distributed, knowledge-based design problems of our time.

Michael has lived in many cities including Toronto, Pittsburgh, London, Berlin, and Rotterdam. His professional interests are both artistic and intellectual. He aims at knowledge integration and simplification. He believes that good ideas donâ€™t have to be complicated or difficult to understand. He believes that both poets and scientists have things to say. He believes that the world desperately needs more good ideas.

Michael lives in Toronto. He grew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Ottawa, Ontario. He supports the Centre for Social Innovation, which has been very supportive in the development of the Ambitious City enterprise. He likes to sing, swim and cycle around downtown Toronto. He is happily married and is the proud father of twin teenage boys.
