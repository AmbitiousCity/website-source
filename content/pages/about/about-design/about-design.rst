We live in an age of unparalleled dynamism, creativity and intellectual ferment. Yet there are also enormous urban problems to solve such as conflict, poverty, alienation and sustainability. There appears to be incredible resources yet there exists a certain paralysis in how to apply them in sensible ways.

Ambitious City proposes that the way out of this predicament is through distributed, collaborative design processes applied to the design of cities. Distributed design processes are ones in which citizens have meaningful input into how their city is designed.

Design of cities is a type of distributed design problem. Design of complex things such as cities can be complicated affairs. You will want them to fulfill certain high-level requirements, for instance you might want a city to be sustainable or an airplane to be safe. To do this you must organize design activity to accomplish those things: in the end you really need the city to be sustainable and the airplane to fly safely, in an evidence-supported manner. These you could call the ‘top-down’ or the centralized aspects of the design problem.

You will likely need a diverse body of stakeholders and design professionals to help solve complex design problems. Collaborative design can be an incredibly complex, crowd-sourced affair and the design team members may not always be able to communicate between themselves very deeply. These are part of the ‘bottom-up’ aspects of design. This is where diversity of opinion is needed as opposed to 'group think.'

Collaborative design is done this way because it has to be done this way. There is no way to centralize design when you need a diverse, distributed design team to do much of the actual work.

The question of design process then becomes how to integrate these two necessary parts together, the bottom-up and the top-down, so that they meet happily in the middle. In this scenario the requirements of the ‘crowd’ are met, and the requirements of the ‘top’ (which, it is hoped, the crowd supports) are also met. The results of this distributed design process should be engaging, rational and beautiful. It doesn’t have to look like a horse designed by committee. It should be as beautiful and coherent as the Parthenon or the Alhambra but designed with creative input from a distributed, diverse humanity. This is the Ambitious City idea.
