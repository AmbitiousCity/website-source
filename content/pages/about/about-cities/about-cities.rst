:summary: About cities


Ambitious City assumes that demographic trends will continue and that most people will live in cities. This isnâ€™t something to be mourned; it is something to be celebrated. Cities are interesting and productive because of their diversity. Cities can be livable and enjoyable when certain norms are met such as human rights, access to peace, freedom, tolerance and security.
