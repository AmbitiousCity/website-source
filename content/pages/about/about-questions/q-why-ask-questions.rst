Urban design questions are useful in that they can encourage curiosity about the nature of the city, they can define what we don't know, they can lead to many good ideas, and they provide a *structure* for good ideas: a good idea is given a context by the question that inspires it. 

We believe that implicit in any good design is a series of good questions. Asking questions is an integral part of an early design phase. During early design basic orientation and conceptual framing takes places that influences later stages of design. 

We also believe there are such things as good questions. A good question is one that encourages a process of learning to determine what its answer might be. It is neither too broad nor too narrow, is non-rhetorical--its purpose should be to uncover something unknown as opposed to a statement the promotes an established position or opinion. It should be *open*, *neutral* and *lean*: a good question doesn't inject a preconceived answer into how what's being asked [this idea is from the work of the Canadian journalist John Sawatsky].
