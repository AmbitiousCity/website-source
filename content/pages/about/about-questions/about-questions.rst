We believe that implicit in any good design is a series of good questions. Asking questions is an integral part of any early design phase. During early design basic orientations and conceptual framing takes places that influences later stages of design.

Urban design questions are useful in that they
--------------------------------------------------

- encourage curiosity about the nature of the city
- define what we don't know
- can lead to many good ideas
- provide a *structure* for good ideas: a good idea is given a context by the question that inspires it.
