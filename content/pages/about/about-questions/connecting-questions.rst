:summary: Connecting questions together

Questions on this site can be about most anything to do with urban design. This site does not attempt to put all its questions into an order that makes sense at first. It might be that experience must be gained writing many questions before an order is discovered that makes sense. But here are some ideas that might be useful in ordering questions:

------

Chronological
	The chronological order in which they appear on the site

------

Hierarchical
	Questions might have related sub-questions--questions that deal with the same topic, but go into greater detail or are subsumed by the 'parent' question

------

Answer or hypothesis based
	Questions may have discoverable answers (or provisional answers) based on available evidence (or just common sense)

------

Narrative-related
	Questions connected together in order to tell a story
