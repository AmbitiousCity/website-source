:summary: How to order questions so they make sense

Questions on this site can be about most anything to do with urban design. This site does not attempt to put all its questions into an order that makes sense at first. It might be that experience must be gained writing many questions before an order is discovered that makes sense. But here are some ideas that might be useful in ordering questions:

Possible orders for questions (and related material such as ideas, sources, hypotheses, etc)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Chronological: the chronological order in which they are thought up (and appear on the site)
- Hierarchical: questions might have related sub-questions, which are questions that deal with the same topic, but go into greater detail
- Narrative-related: questions that have related material that seems to flow naturally for telling some kind of story
- Answer-based: some questions have discoverable answers based on available evidence (or just common sense)
