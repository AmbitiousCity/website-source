This is an experimental site for urban design. The goal is to identify and refine good ideas for the design of cities. Currently, we have three items of interest: *Ideas*, *Questions* and *Sources*. These are linked together in a straightforward way. 


Some of our motivating ideas
--------------------------------------------------

- A good *Question* is an important thing in that it encourages curiosity
- *Questions* might inspire many *Ideas*
- *Questions* and *Ideas* have likely been thought about and discussed before; hence, *Sources* are useful.


Initial Question 01
--------------------------------------------------
`How should cities be built? <{filename} ../articles/root01/q-how-should-cities-be-built/q-how-should-cities-be-built.rst>`_
