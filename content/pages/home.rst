Welcome to Ambitious City!

This is an experimental site for urban design. The goal is to identify and refine good ideas for the design of cities. Currently, we have three items of interest: *Ideas*, *Questions* and *Sources*. These are linked together in a straightforward way. 


Some of our motivating ideas
--------------------------------------------------


- A good *Question* is an important thing
- *Questions* might inspire many *Ideas*
- Most good *Ideas* are probably linked to good *Questions*
- *Questions* and *Ideas* have likely been thought about and discussed before; hence, *Sources* are useful.
